A couple of my mates from back in [Perth](http://www.westernaustralia.com/en/) have embarked on an effort to recondition and supercharge an old [JE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Camira#JE_.281987-1989.29) [Holden Camira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Camira).

They have [started a blog](http://superchargedcamira.wordpress.com "Supercharged Camira") to let us all know what they are up to, and keep track of the project.

I spent the first 3.5 years of my driving career banging about in a maroon [JD Camira](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Camira#JD_.281985-1987.29), it did me well and hardly ever broke down.

The project is centered around learning how to reprogram an old Delco EFI ECU, and to make it a bit more challenging they decided to supercharge the beast while they were at it.

I look forward to seeing the results and loaning the car when i&#8217;m back in Perth and need a new ride  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

Good luck guys.
