No?

I didn&#8217;t think so.

But aparently [there are people out there who do](http://www.snooztime.com/zencart/index.php?main_page=infopages&#038;pages_id=3 "How much did your pillow cost in 15,000BC."), along with a whole lot of other things about your pillow back then. We may aswell take back the award we gave to the inventor of polyester (if there was ever such an award) as it seems they were using it way back then, too.

I wonder who you call to find out information like that.
