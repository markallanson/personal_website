No, not to Apple computers; Rather, I have moved my blogging platform over to [WordPress](http://wordpress.org "WordPress Website") for my main weblog (the one your reading now). [Mark &#038; Sarah in the UK](http://uk.markallanson.net/ "Mark &#038; Sarah in the UK") will stay on Movable Type for now, and my old weblog will remain accessible via it&#8217;s existing url, [http://markallanson.net/weblog](http://markallanson.net/weblog "My old weblog.").

My first impressions of WordPress have left me with the feeling that [Six Apart](http://sixapart.com "The Six Apart Website.") has a long, long way to go before getting their software up to the standard of WordPress in both features provided and fit-and-polish of the overall user experience. The WordPress user interface is a very nice place to be, thats for sure.

I&#8217;ve also made another switch. I am now using [Flock](http://flock.com "The Flock Web Browser") as my full-time web browser. My main reason for using Flock full time, i&#8217;m ashamed to admit, is that i&#8217;m a sucker for a pretty user interface and the default skin for Flock is absolutely gorgeous. I have also recently [started to use del.icio.us for bookmarking](http://del.icio.us/markallanson "My del.icio.us Bookmarks"), and Flock&#8217;s integration with [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us "del.icio.us Website") (as well as the ability to post weblog entries within a specialised editor in the browser) is a killer feature for me.

You may be wondering why I have bothered to switch my blogging platform given how little I actually post. Well, it was generally an exercise to satisfy my curiosity surrounding the traction WordPress has gathered recently, simple as that.
