I just got myself a new [Orange SPV E200 Windows Mobile 2003 Smartphone](http://shop.orange.co.uk/shop/show/handset/orange_spv_e200/details). Consequently I had to update my MSN Messenger Mobile profile so messages sent to me while offline would go to my new phone.

Upon selecting the new Country (UK) and new Providor (orange), I had to agree to the terms of service which state that Orange can charge ME 10 pence for each message I \_RECEIVE\_. Yes, thats right, they want to charge me for receiving messages.

Fat chance! Service disabled, sorry!

PS. This smartphone rocks!
