I have passwords coming out of my ears, so many in fact that I went to download a trial version of [Macromedia Fireworks MX](http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/?promoid=home_prod_fw_082403) this morning and i couldn&#8217;t for the life of me remember my password for the Macromedia site.

Time to find a password storage app for Windows. I found [Password Keychain](http://www.nfxtech.com/products_passwordkeychain.htm), but seeings as i&#8217;m a sucker for sexy apps and I have a week or so before I start work it&#8217;s time to roll my own .NET password storage application, and make it integrate with Mozilla Firefox, and maybe Internet Exploder too.

Keep an eye out.
