Not sure whats going on with TextAmerica when using Mozilla 0.7. I created a Moblog earlier on today (<http://markallans.textamerica.com>) for use with [Sarah and my new UK website (http://uk.markallanson.net/)](http://uk.markallanson.net/). Any TextAmerica webpage that is longer that one screen has no scroll bars and does not allow you to scroll. Is it just me that is experiencing this behaviour?

Seems to work fine if I fire up IE though.
