When capturing a COMException (in my case specifically it was an Automation Error) inside&nbsp;.NET managed code always check the ExcepotionObject.Source parameter as this will contain the error text generated by the COM component that has generated the error.

Don&#8217;t waste your time checking the Message or Stacktrace parameters as you are just wasting your time (they won&#8217;t give&nbsp; you any usefull information).
