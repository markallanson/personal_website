I have put up a [new photo gallery](http://www.markallanson.net/images/index.cgi?gallery=UK%202003/Sarahs%20Rooms%20December%202003) showing pictures of the room(s) that Sarah has been living in for the last 2 months. Pretty small stuff!

On another note, I have moved into our new flat. Theres been a lot of lifting, a lot of shifting, a lot of cleaning and a lot of mopping, but its finally beginning to look like a home. I will take some photos of the place soon and put them online. We have a fully stocked kitchen, but are still without much furniture, we went to IKEA to buy some stuff but they were sold out of /everything/ that we wanted to order (A sofa, bed and armchair), so we are going to have to wait for the new year before putting in any furniture.

Here are our movements over the xmas / new years break(s).

Now -> Wed 24 @ 4pm, At home
  
Thursday 25th -> Sunday 28th, Down south in Devon with my family for Xmas
  
Monday 29th -> Wednesday 31st, At Home
  
Thursday 1st -> Sunday 4th, Down south in Devon for my cousins (Victoria) Wedding.

I will put up a photo gallery of the new appartment before we leave.
