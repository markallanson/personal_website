Well its been a bit hectic, i&#8217;ve been everywhere at once this week finalising everything and preparing to pack before I leave. It has been confirmed that I will be picked up by my uncle in london so that is fantastic news, the last thing I need after 27 hours of travel is to have to find a way of getting to their house on my own!.

At the moment it looks as if I am packing for a holiday, and i have a sneaking suspision that I am going to leave too many important things behind, but so be it, they can get sent over later if they are that important.

I&#8217;m sure there are 100 things I havent thought of yet that I will need to do before I leave, but hopefully at least 90 of them come to me before saturday  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
