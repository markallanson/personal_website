Well I am waiting in the departure lounge of Perth Airport, laptop in lap, connected to my first wireless hotspot. I wasn&#8217;t really expecting to find a hotspot here at Perth Airport, but i&#8217;m stoked that I did  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

Its a good way to kill some time, however I just need to get my longer battery, I have a long flight ahead of my (about 25 hours in total including stopover time). and my battery that lasts 2.5 hours just isn&#8217;t going to cut the mustard.

Anyway, Wish me a good flight. I will try and blog again in Brunei  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
