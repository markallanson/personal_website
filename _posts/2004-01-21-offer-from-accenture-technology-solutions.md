What a nice email title to receive when doing a routine send/receive.

Of course I have accepted the offer and I start with Accenture Technology Solutions on 23rd February as a C# .NET Software Engineer. I am looking forward to the challenges that this position within Accenture can provide me, and the solutions I am going to help provide.

I will be based in the London Denning House Delivery Centre.
