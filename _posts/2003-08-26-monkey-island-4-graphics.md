After completing Monkey Island 2 and 3 from the collectors edition boxed set I bought last month I have begun to dig into the 4th in the series, Escape from Monkey Island.

Initially I was looking forward to the 3d graphics and new UI, however after the gorgeousness of Curse of Monkey Islands hand drawn 2d, the 3d was blocky and edgy, I was disheartened to say the least, until I decided to force anti-aliasing on in the nVidia driver, and suddenly the graphics became so so silky smooth.

If you&#8217;re playing EFMI and are dissapointed in the graphics, go to your display properties and force your graphics driver into the highest Anti-Aliasing mode possible, its a dream.
