Seeings as others seem to be doing this at the moment, its an interesting statistic to track I guess. Here is my browser usage chart since May. This chart covers 2 domains, those being \*.ftowa.com and \*.markallanson.net. Given that FtoWA.com is a completely non-tech site, this gives a reasonable cross-section of society.

<img src="http://www.markallanson.net/images/weblog/BrowserUsageToNovember2004.jpg" alt="" border="0" />Im not sure if you can glean anything from these charts other than IE is still completely owning the market, despite the fact that Mozilla is slowly edging up. The &#8220;Unknown&#8221; section on this chart is sources that [AWStats](http://awstats.sourceforge.net/ "AWStats") can&#8217;t classify, and all the RSS news aggregators generally get lumped in here. &#8220;Others&#8221; are those that I couldn&#8217;t be bothered breaking down into individual sources as they would basically be a straight line at almost zero, this list includes (but is not limited to) Netscape, most Mobile Phone browsers, LibWWW (general purpose http library), Safari, Gaelon, Konqueror, Lynx, etc&#8230;

I think out of everyone, Opera seems to be taking the biggest hammering, poor little guy, up and down like a rollercoaster. Without further ago I present my graph.

PS. I tried to do some neat [sparklines](http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001Eb&topic_id=1 "Sparklines Text") for this post, but excel sucks to much at creating nice resolution charts. In fact, I even tried generating a nice big graph, then sampling down to a very small one in a photo program, but I don&#8217;t think I actually have enough samples to generate a nice sparkline. Maybe if I had daily, or even weekly samples since May I might have enough data for some sparklines.
