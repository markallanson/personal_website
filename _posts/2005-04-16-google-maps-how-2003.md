For all those having wet dreams over google maps, then may I point you to [MultiMap.com&#8217;s](http://multimap.com "Multimap Homepage") Aerial View that has existed for at least the last few years.

Here is a the [MultiMap Aerial view of central-ish London](http://multimap.com/map/photo.cgi?client=public&X=529026&Y=181499&width=700&height=410&gride=587373&gridn=185329&srec=0&coordsys=gb&db=pc&pc=&zm=0&scale=100000&multimap.x=413&multimap.y=183 "Central London Multimap Aerial View").

Notice, that the street map is overlaid on top of the sattelite imagery as you move your mouse around the map. It doesn&#8217;t have the nice ajaxability of google maps, but it has been around for a while now, and the street map overlay is very cool. Aerials are only for the UK, though.
