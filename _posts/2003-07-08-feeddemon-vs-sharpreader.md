Is it just me or is everyone having high CPU utilisation issues with [FeedDemon](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/)?

Other than the CPU utilisation, FeedDemon is not to bad, I like the &#8220;Daily Newspaper&#8221; view for an overall view of posts, however the 3 vertical panes layout seems more of a hinderance than a help. Back to [SharpReader](www.sharpreader.com) for me.

[Luke](http://www.hutteman.com/weblog/), please add the awesome browser functionality as used in FeedDemon, but switch to embedded gecko!  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
