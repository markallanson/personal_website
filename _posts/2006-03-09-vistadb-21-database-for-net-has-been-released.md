[VistaDB](http://vistadb.com "VistaDB's Website") have one upped [Axosoft](http://axosoft.com "Axosoft Website")&#8216;s meme tracking marketing campaign by offering VistaDB free to .NET and Visual Studio bloggers mentioning their campaign on their blog. 

I have heard good reports about VistaDB from others but have been unable to try it myself as I have always placed my trust in the MSDE variant of SQL Server for any client side database requirements. This may be the time for&nbsp; me to jump ship to a .NET focussed system!

&nbsp;Their blog-release (well, its not really a press release, is it) for VistaDB v2.1 is reprinted below!
