On Saturday morning I was lucky enough to spend some time walking around [Priory Park](http://www.visitsouthend.co.uk/ParksGardens/PrioryPark.htm "Priory Park"), in Southend with my camera and tripod in tow. I only had an hour, and didn&#8217;t get to explore even close to half of the park so I will have to take a trip back there this spring and this time allow more time for the visit.

Here&#8217;s a sample of the photographs that came out of the cold morning. I can&#8217;t wait to revisit in spring!
