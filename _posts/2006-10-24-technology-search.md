[Google](http://google.com "Google") has recently released [Co-Op](http://google.com/coop "Google Co-Op"), allowing for customized search within specific sites.

I thought I would celebrate by [creating my own search engine](http://markallanson.net/dsearch/ "Development Search"), [Mark&#8217;s Development Search](http://markallanson.net/dsearch/ "Development Search"). This will be an invaluable tool for developers all around the world searching for the answers to all their development needs.  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

PS. If you have a site that you believe should be added to my search engine, [let me know](mailto:mark@markallanson.net "Let me know about a web page.").
