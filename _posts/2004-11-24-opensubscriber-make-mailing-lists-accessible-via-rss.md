A long time friend of mine recently founded [openSubscriber](http://opensubscriber.com "openSubscriber - Mailing lists made public."). It is a simple way to create a public archive of a mailing lists that will be accessible to the general public long after it has dissapeared from the harddisks of the subscribers.

This is a neat idea by its self, however the coolest thing about the site is it allows you to subscribe to the mailing lists via RSS, so you can now syndicate any mailing list feed into your favorite aggregator without having to rely on mailing list software authors.

All he needs to do now is find a nice way to allow replying to mailing list posts via the subscribed RSS feeds.
