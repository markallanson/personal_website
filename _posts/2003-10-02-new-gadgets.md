Now that I have resigned I must get everything ready for the trip to the UK. My 2 main preparation items are of course, gadgets. Sold is my old Kodak DC3800 Point-and-click camera, replaced with an [Olympus C-740](http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&p=16&bc=2&product=909).

3.2Mp, 10x Optical Zoom 3x Digital zoom (max zoom 30x). This camera rocks! Image quality is fantastic.

Second is the fact that I cannot live without a computer, seeings as I cant really ship my desktop over to the UK (well I can, but I dont want to), I have jumped in and bought a new Laptop. Pre-requisites: 1. must be an ultra-light. 2: Must have 802.11b/g.

So I splashed out on a new [Dell Latitiude X300](http://www.ap.dell.com/ap/au/en/bsd/products/model_latit_3_latit_x300.htm) Ultralight.

this thing is awesome. only 1.3kgs and 0.8&#8243; thick. Unfortunately it won&#8217;t arrive for 10-12 business days.. Of course, being a geek I couldn&#8217;t leave it at the base specs so I chopped and changed it a bit

  * Out goes the 30gb HDD, replaced with a 60gb HDD 
      * Added an extra 256Mb Ram, taking it to 384Mb 
          * Out with the Intel PRO 802.11b mini PCI card, in with the Dell TrueMobileTMÂ 1400 WLAN (802.11b/g) 
              * Swapped the CD drive for a DVD/CD-RW Combo drive</ul> 
                I already can&#8217;t wait and I still have 9-11 business days left  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
