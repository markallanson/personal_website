It has finally been confirmed that the [WilliamsF1](http://www.williamsf1.com "WilliamsF1 website") team are dropping [Mark Webber](http://www.markwebber.com "Mark Webbers Website") for the 2007 Formula 1 season and replacing him with current test driver [Alex Wurz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wurz "Alexander Wurz @ Wikipedia").

Given that WilliamsF1 had an option on Mark Webber&#8217;s services for 2007, and given his performances this season have been outstanding despite mechanical failures causing many retirements I can only imagine that the cost of the new [Toyota](http://www.toyota-f1.com/public/index.html "Toyota F1 Website") engines for next year must have priced him out of the market for the team.
  
Webber has only completed 4 of the 12 races this season, with 6 of his 8 retirements due to mechanical failure, 2 due to being caught up in other peoples accidents.

This is a shame as I really do like the WilliamsF1 team. However my real aliegence is with Webber so my team support next year will follow to whichever team he joins. Given [RenaultF1](http://www.renaultf1.com/en/ "RenaultF1 Website") has a spare race seat next year, and Flavio Briatore is Webbers manager, it would seem that he is the prime candidate for a drive there alongside Giancarlo Fisichella.

It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few weeks &#8211; to see who he signs for.
