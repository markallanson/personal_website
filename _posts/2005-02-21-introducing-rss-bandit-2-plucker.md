If you are someone who uses Rss Bandit and use a PalmOS based device and have been lamenting the lack of decent offline Rss Aggregator then worry no longer. Grab a copy of **Rss Bandit 2 Plucker**, which works with both [Rss Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/ "Rss Bandit Website") and [Plucker](http://www.plkr.org "Plucker Website") to synchronise your unread items in Rss Bandit to your device.

**Rss Bandit 2 Plucker** is not software that gets installed on your PalmOS based handheld, it gets installed on your PC and acts as a pipe that transfers and converts data between Rss Bandit and Plucker. Plucker automatically runs **Rss Bandit 2 Plucker** when you attempt to synchronise the channel (which can be automatically run on a schedule), so after setup has been completed, there is no manual intervention required.

It is so simple to use i&#8217;ve made a short video that demonstrates everything from running the setup program to performing your first synchronisation. This video runs through everything that you have to do to get up and running.
