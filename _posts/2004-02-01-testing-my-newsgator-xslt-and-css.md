Well it seems that NewsGator allows you to create custom transforms for feeds (and even on an individual feed basis!). Unfortuantely the XSLT transform happens very early on right when data is stored into the PST file, which sorta negates the whole concept behind XSLT, doesn&#8217;t it?

Anyway, this is a post to test my transform. I will post up the files when i&#8217;m done.
