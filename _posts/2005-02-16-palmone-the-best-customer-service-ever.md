I have just experienced the best customer service, ever.

During my move from the Oz to the UK late 2003 I lost the installation CD for my PalmOne Tungsten E handheld. Unfortunately this CD is the only way of installing the Outlook conduits (that allow me to sync my Outlook email and contacts etc), and other software (Versamail).

I sent a support request to PalmOne asking how I can get ahold of a new CD, and within a few hours had a response asking for my address, informing me they will send me a replacement product CD, **free of charge.**

Wow, I didn&#8217;t expect that, I expected to have to pay Â£10.00 or so for a replacement CD. This was about 10 days ago.

This morning, what should arrive in the mailbox but a brand new product CD. Such a simple thing, but done so well! Thanks PalmOne, thats showing &#8216;em how exceptional customer service is done!
