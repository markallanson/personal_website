After the events in London today I think it might be prudent to say that both Sarah and I are safe and sound. My office is on Fenchurch Street, a few minutes walk from Aldgate, however I was not affected by the tragic events of today.

Our thoughts and best wishes are with all those who have lost family members in the events of today.
