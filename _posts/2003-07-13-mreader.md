Im working on mReader, a RSS Aggregator for J2ME enabled devices (mobile phones etc).

What do people want in an aggregator of this size. It can&#8217;t store feeds, so it has to download every time, which could be a killer on download charges. You will be able to point the reader at an online OPML file though so you can select which feeds you want to download, for example, save your sharpreader opml to a website, and point the phone at it to get a list of contacts.
