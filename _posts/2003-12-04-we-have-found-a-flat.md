After sifting through some absolutely terrible flats and houses, Sarah and I have finally decided on a place to live. It is in [Westcliff-on-Sea](http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?GridE=587140&GridN=185339&client=public&X=587140&Y=185339&place=Westcliff-on-Sea,Southend&db=hcgaz&local=&type=&start=&coordsys=gb&limit=&overviewmap=&scale=100000 "Map of Westcliff-on-Sea"), an area roughly equivalent to a suburb, just west of Southend-on-Sea. We are near the sea front, although not with a sea view. Time to walk to the beach would most probably average about 5 minutes as you have to go down a long flight of steps and a path to reach it. The beach isn&#8217;t much to speak of anyway, its not white sand, just grey sand (maybe even shells / pebbles, we haven&#8217;t ventured onto the beach yet).

There are some movie theatres about 5 minutes walk away, a number of hotels and pubs within 5-10 minutes walk away (in fact the nearest pub would be about 30 seconds walk to the end of the street away, but its inside a hotel so i&#8217;m not counting that one   <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />) . We are about 5-10 minutes walk from the Westcliff train station so the commute into London shouldn&#8217;t be too hard, just expensive  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />.

The flat is a first floor flat, with cedar wood flooring through the hallway and living room, bathroom, kitchen (with included washer/dryer, fridge/freezer), large sunken master bedroom and reasonable sized second bedroom, so if anyone wants to visit, you&#8217;re most welcome! The flat is recently renovated as well so everything looks brand new and is in excellent condition.

I have also added a new photo gallery in the [pictures section](http://www.markallanson.net/html/pictures.html "Pictures Section"), under [United Kingdom, 2003](http://www.markallanson.net/html/pictures-uk.html "United Kingdom, 2003"). I took a trip to [Windsor Castle](http://www.markallanson.net/images/index.cgi?gallery=UK%202003%2FWindsor%20Castle%20November%202003 "Windsor Castle Picture Gallery") after a mistake with Air Emirates cargo division left me with a hire car for a day and nothing to use it for. I did a tour of the castle and got to view the state rooms inside. Amasing stuff.

Stay tuned for some pictures of the house over the coming weeks. We should be able to move into the flat in 2-3 weeks time, hopefully before xmas.

On another note, I changed the pictures gallery around so its a bit easier to navigate, the picture narrative is now at the top of the screen, and navigation buttons have been placed at the top to. Look out for more changes to make it a bit easier in the coming weeks.
