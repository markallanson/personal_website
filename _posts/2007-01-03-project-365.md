I&#8217;ve decided to join [Project 365](http://flickr.com/groups/28845821@N00/ "Project 365 Flickr Group"). It&#8217;s a Flickr group. Each member of the group has to take one picture, every day, for one year.

Here&#8217;s Day 1.

[<img style="border-left-color: black; border-bottom-color: black; border-top-color: black; border-right-color: black" height="338" alt="Day 1" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/136/344484102_1625a2de7e.jpg" width="450" border="1" />](http://www.flickr.com/photos/markallanson/344484102/ "Photo Sharing") 

Photo&#8217;s will be taken with one of my cams, either the EOS 350D, FinePix F650 or a cameraphone. Lets see if I can keep this up for the year. Anyone want to start taking bets?  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />

I probably won&#8217;t post the images every day, but I will definately take one every day, and might post them up every few days, or week. I definately won&#8217;t post all the photo&#8217;s here, so you&#8217;ll have to checker Flickr intermittantly to keep up to date.

The PhotoSet with all photo&#8217;s [can be found here](http://flickr.com/photos/markallanson/sets/72157594457397188/ "All my Project 365 Photographs").
