Very much like [Mun](http://www.munsplace.com/blogger/ "Muns Place") i&#8217;ve recently starting getting a lot of search engine hits for &#8220;Accenture+Interview&#8221; in my referrer logs recently. [Accenture Technology Solutions](http://www.accenture.co.uk/ats/) (ATS) must be on a massive hiring drive, or at least they must be in the UK!

I&#8217;m not sure that there is much help either of us can give to anyone that is interviewing with ATS at the moment. If you know your stuff and are a good communicator then you should have no troubles acquiring a position with ATS. The HR interviews are the same you will experience at any medium-large enterprise. The skills interview will catch you out if you don&#8217;t know your stuff, so shy away from applying for positions that you are not qualified for, and be wary of padding your CV with falsehoods. (I know this is a &#8220;durr&#8221; type moment but im sure there are people out there that do it   <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />)

On another note, Mun, maybe we should set up &#8220;Accenture Bloggers&#8221; OPML file and create a synthetic feed using [Feedster](http://www.feedster.com/) along the lines of what [Alex Hoffman has done for Australian .NET bloggers](http://weblogs.asp.net/ahoffman/archive/2004/02/02/66085.aspx)? If anyone is interested drop a comment onto this post (if any accenture bloggers actually find my blog).
