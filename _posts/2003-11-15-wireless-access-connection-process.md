This is pretty cool, here is the process I had to go through to connect to the hotspot.

  1. Enable my wireless adaptor
  2. Let it find the hotspot, Its a telstra hotspot.
  3. Fire up your browser, you will be taken to the Telstra WiFi access point loigin page.
  4. Enter details about how you wnt to pay. If you have a Telstra mobile you can use that as access.
  5. An SMS is sent to your telstra mobile, with a token number
  6. Enter the token number into the browser form
  7. You are authenticated, full internet access!

I sorta expected it to be free-for-all, but I can understand why its not. At least the registration process was incredibly simple.
