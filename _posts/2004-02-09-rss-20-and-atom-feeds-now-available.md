Tonight I have finally updated my ageing feed standards and you can now subscribe to my blog using RSS 2.0 or ATOM (See subscription links above). I also made use the new &#8220;feed:&#8221; URI scheme so if you use a compliant News Aggregator a simple single click should subscribe.

I will maintain the RDF, RSS 0.91 and RSS 1.0 feeds in their old locations so nothing will break.
