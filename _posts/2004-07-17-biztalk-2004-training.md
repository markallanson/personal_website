On Sunday I&#8217;m jetting off to Chicago for a [Biztalk 2004 training course](http://www.imginc.com/IMG/Education+Services/ClassDetails.htm?courseID=1552) from [IMG](http://www.imginc.com/). I&#8217;ve been maintaining an existing Biztalk 2002 implementation for a while now, and have just been recruited to help a transition to Biztalk 2004, so its time to go on some formal training as there are currently no books available anywhere!

I have WiFi in my hotel room so will be contactable via email and will be on MSN Messenger at various times over the week. If anyone wants to get together for dinner drop me an email, i&#8217;m staying at Club Quarters, Wacker at Michigan (75 E Wacker Drive), near the river on the Magnificent Mile. Training venue is One IBM Plaza.
