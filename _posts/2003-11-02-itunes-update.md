I decided to give iTunes a fair go. Seeings as I am moving to the UK this month and the last thing I needed to was haul 150 or so CD&#8217;s globally I decided to rip them all to my laptop as mp3s. This task was entrusted to iTunes.

I can honestly say that there was not 1 hiccup over the few weeks that I was ripping the cds. All of them encoded in sweet 160kbps quality (in my opinion the best compromise between size and quality). I love the jukebox features, smart playlists etc.

Despite the fact that It doesnt act like all other well behaved Windows apps i have now uninstalled Winamp and am using iTunes exclusively.

But the best Windows app ever? Hardly.

PS. This is my first post written in [Zempt](http://www.zempt.com/ "Zempt Blogger Program"). Seems to work okay, they just need to eye-candy it up a bit  <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />
