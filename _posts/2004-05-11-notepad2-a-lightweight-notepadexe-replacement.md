There&#8217;s not many things more important for a software developer than a great lightweight text editor. Something that sits between the Windows standard notepad.exe and an advanced editor such as [UltraEdit32](http://www.ultraedit.com "The UltraEdit32 Text Editor") and [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com/ "The TextPad Text Editor.").

That search is over, [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html "The NotePad2, Lightweight Text Editor."), from my intial usage it is extremely quick and provides customisable syntax highlighting, Simple to access (&#8220;Windows-R, notepad2.exe&#8221; instead of &#8220;Windows-R, notepad.exe&#8221;), as well as a few other nice features.

Seems to be a keeper.
