<img width="221" height="492" alt="Mark's Plasma running on Nokia 7210 emulator." style="float: left; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px" src="/images/technical/j2me/plasma/Technical_PlasmaScreenShot.jpg" />This version of plasma is a mixture of multiple types of plasma taken from multiple sources. Initially started to see how easy it would be to port a java app to J2ME, it ended up being an exercise of trying to get a good plasma routine to run at a decent speed on the Nokia 7210 mobile phone.

There are multiple modes including full, half and quarter resolution modes, aswell as interlaced mode. For best results use quarter resolution. Turning on interlaced mode in quarter resolution provides reasonably quick results. Newer phones should be able to run this in higher modes without so much of a speed penalty.
