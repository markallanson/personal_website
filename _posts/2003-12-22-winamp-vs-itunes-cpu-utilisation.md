I just downloaded and installed WinAmp 5.01, in an effort to compare CPU usage with iTunes. iTunes uses (on average) a ghastly 15-20% of CPU when playing my ripped tracks (Ripped in iTunes), WinAmp on the other hand uses (on average) about 5-7% of CPU). This is on a 1.2Ghz Pentium-M CPU with 384mb RAM.
