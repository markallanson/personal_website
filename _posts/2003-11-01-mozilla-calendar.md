Oh, btw, I thought that I should mention that about a week (give or take) after posting about my problems getting the Calendar to work with Mozilla Firebird 0.7 it just started working. I didn&#8217;t touch a thing, honest! (I had almost given up on it and had started re-entering my calendar into OutlookXP)
