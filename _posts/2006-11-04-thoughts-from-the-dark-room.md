Sometimes I think that the world is too complex.

Is too the right work there, or is it to?

I want to come too.

I wonder exactly how distraction free Darkroom actually is. If IÂ  receive an MSN IM, will the bubble pop up over the top of DarkRoom? Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have enough friends to test that theory with, i&#8217;ve been on MSN the last hour and no one has written me.

DarkRoom is much nicer to use with fixed with font like Consolas than with a proportional width font like Calibri. Somehow Calibri takes away the simpleness that is DarkRoom.

I tried Candara too, that also did not work well.

CTRL-S to Save. CTRL-O to Open. CTRL-P to Print. CTRL-X to Cut. CTRL-C to Copy. CTRL-V to Paste. CTRL-Z to Undo. CTRL-Y to Redo. CTRL-SHIFT-Z to Undo. Should not CTRL-SHIFT-Z by Redo?

Why doesn&#8217;t CTRL-SHIFT-X perform the opposite to CTRL-X?

I can&#8217;t figure out how to exit DarkRoom. I wonder if I will be stuck here forever?
