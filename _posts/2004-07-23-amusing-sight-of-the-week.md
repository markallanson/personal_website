A Row of people sitting on the floor against a wall in Chicago Ohare airport so that they can plug their notebooks into a power supply.

When are we going to get 12 hour notebook batteries like the new iPod, eh?

Anyways, my flight leaves in a few hours, looking forward to heading home, thanks Chicago its been a good week.
