Orienation day 1 provided a mix of presentation, gifts, food and good company! We have a fantastic bunch of new joiners (about 24 in total from memory).

Luckily I have been placed on some London based .NET and .NET Compact Framework projects. Can&#8217;t wait to get my hands dirty on the Compact Framework work, it is a very interesting little project even if I am being pulled in only for a short amount of time to finish off some UI elements. My base of work will be in PC based .NET however, and after my short stint of compact framework work I will start that full time.

Its going to be an exciting entrace into the world of Accenture!
