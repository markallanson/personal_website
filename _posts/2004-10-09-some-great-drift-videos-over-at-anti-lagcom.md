Head over to [Anti-lag.com](http://www.antilag.com/videos/) for some great drift and drag combat video&#8217;s taken during an [MC Motorsport](http://www.mcmotorsport.com.au) drift training day & the drag combat competition, WA round.

I am really missing the Perth modified car scene and modified cars in general. They just don&#8217;t know how to do it anywhere near as well over here in the UK. To many modified hot hatches and not enough real power cars. I guess with such confined spaces anything over a couple of litres doesn&#8217;t make very much sense.

Looking forward to getting back to Perth and dropping some cash on something with a decent amount of power and turbo without having to worry about selling a kidney to pay the insurance bill.
