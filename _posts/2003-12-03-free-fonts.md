I know how frustrating it is to find good quality free fonts, but if you are into typewriter style fonts, and want to browse about 300 different types from old style broken typewriters to the just plain wierd typewriter then check out the [Free Typewriter Fonts Website](http://www.free-typewriter-fonts.com/ "Free Typewriter Fonts Website"). I have been sitting on this link for about 12 months but only just figured it might be helpfull for others. The typewriter style font I use on this website is _1942 Report_.
