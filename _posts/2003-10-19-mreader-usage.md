I know that a fair amount of people have downloaded mReader, but I dont know exact figures for downloads.

So, if you have downloaded and are using mReader, please drop me an email to let me know what you like, and what you think sucks. I know people using the SonyEricsson P800 have been having some problems, so if someone is successfully using mReader on this device I would be interested to know how you got it working.
