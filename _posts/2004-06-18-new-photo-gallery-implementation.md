I have finally had the time and inspiration to dump my 2 year old perl scripts that were running my photo gallery and install and configure the [free/open source Gallery software](http://gallery.menalto.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=index "Gallery Software").

I intially tried out this program about 8 or 9 months ago however I found it quite cumbersome to use, and the windows java based client was pretty un-user-friendly. Something that I didn&#8217;t notice, that was pointed out to me today by [Tolli](http://www.tolli.com "Tolli's Website"), is that you can install a registry patch that allows you to publish your photo&#8217;s directly into gallery directly from your local machines file system using the [Microsoft Windows XP Web Publishing Wizard](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/webpub_overview.mspx "Windows XP Web Publishing Wizard documentation"). Using this feature of Windows XP updating your photo gallery is a matter of going to the folder that you want to publish as a photo gallery, enter the publishing wizard, follow a few steps that include selecting that you want to publish to Gallery and voila, done.

So, [you can now visit the new and improved photo gallery](http://www.markallanson.net/gallery "The new and improved photo gallery"). I still have not migrated over all the old photo galleries, and have not yet migrated over any of the photo descriptions or commentary, but I will get them done soon. Also note that I have published the photo&#8217;s from our New York City visit. Note that you can also comment on the photo&#8217;s so if you have something to say about a particular photo please punch it in.
