I took the BMW on its first long run today, 2 sessions of 1 hour and was impressed at the fuel milage being shown on the MPG meter on the dashboard.

I have decided to keep a record of fuel milage for every fill up to give others thinking of picking up one of these cars some food for thought. It will be a while before the table below begins to really mean anything though, so give it a few months. 

<div align="center">
  <table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
    <tr>
      <th>
        Date
      </th>
      
      <th>
        Milage
      </th>
      
      <th>
        Litres
      </th>
      
      <th>
        PPL
      </th>
      
      <th>
        Cost
      </th>
      
      <th>
        Supplier
      </th>
      
      <th>
        Fuel Grade
      </th>
      
      <th>
        MBF
      </th>
      
      <th>
        MPG
      </th>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
