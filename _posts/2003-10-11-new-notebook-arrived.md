Wow, I&#8217;m impressed. I always figured that packages you are waiting for the most always tend to arrive the latest.

I was pleasently surprised on Thursday to have my Dell Lattitude X300 arrive 5 days ahead of schedule. So, from the time my order was placed till the time that the notebook arrived (including approval of finance) was only 6 days. That was even though I made a number of changes to the spec of the notebook.

Dell has a system that works, and im very impressed.
