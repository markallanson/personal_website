I&#8217;ve been doing some work on mReader and should have a version 1.1 ready to release sometime during the next week. The following things have been addressed so far:

1. More tolerant to post content in general. You shouldn&#8217;t get any more empty lists of posts when you try to load a feed.
  
2. an attempt to translate some HTML tags and &&#8230;; codes into something readable on Midp devices (ie lists are given asterix&#8217;s etc).
  
3. Proper Progress Indicators and Threading to make the device look like it is doing something, not just telling you it is doing something.
  
4. An out of memory exception catcher so that you know if a feed is too big. (ie .Net Notes)

If anyone has some feature requests give me a holler.
