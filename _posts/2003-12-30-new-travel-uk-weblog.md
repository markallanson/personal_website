I have moved all travel / UK related stuff over to a new weblog co-authored by both Sarah and Myself. If you just want to keep track of what we are doing in the UK, then the best place to check would be the weblog [Sarah and Mark in the UK](http://www.markallanson.net/uk). I will not be posting any more travel related stuff to this weblog.

So, i will repeat this, for anyone only wanting to check out travel related stuff, things written by both Sarah and Myself, then you should visit <http://www.markallanson.net/uk>.
