As reported in [The Australian IT](http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,6698740%5E15306%5E%5Enbv%5E,00.html) as well as other major news vendors around the country, email scams advertising fake online banking websites are hitting people hard.

It&#8217;s a shame that a large proportion of Internet users are not knowledgable enough to weed out the scams from the authentic. Hopefully no one will be hit to hard. The fake websites seems to be a front for collecting personal information.

What is the solution to this problem?
