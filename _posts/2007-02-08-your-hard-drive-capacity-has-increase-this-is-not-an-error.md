Helpfull, this.

![Your hard drive capacity has increase. This is NOT an error.](/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/what.png "Your hard drive capacity has increase. This is NOT an error.")

So, why exactly are you bothering me with this dialog that I can only Cancel? I&#8217;m not going to even start to go into what is wrong with this error message and how it could confuse new computer users.

Hooray for leased computers and the junky software that is installed on them.
