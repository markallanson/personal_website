[Paul V](http://www.panopticoncentral.net) says in [this post](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/permalink.aspx/a4316330-c6d3-403e-a14d-fc0445c74798) that [this article](http://searchvb.techtarget.com/tip/1,289483,sid8_gci914179,00.html) contradicts itsself by claiming that VB is not a better OO language than C#, but later in the article goes on to comment that VB is quicker to develop in than C#.

Since when is speed of development the only indicator as to what language is better than another to use for development of a particular product?
