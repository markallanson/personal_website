So I heard about how good the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 MkII lens was for its price, and, despite the cons of the lens (plastic lens mount and reported noisy auto focus) I decided the pros (such good value, f/1.8 aperature, good reviews especially surrouning image sharpness, really, really light) outweighed it enough to pony up the cash and have my first forey into the world of prime lenses. I look forward to the photos that come out of this lens.
