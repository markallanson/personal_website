Damn this thing rocks. Google has beat MS to the punch! [Google Desktop Search](http://desktop.google.com/) indexes a bunch of common file formats and allows you to search you entire computer very quickly. Inside documents, outside documents etc. It is hosted in your web browser, and runs on port 4664. Effectively you could search your own PC from outside a firewall if you open up the port. Not that this would be recommended of course due to security concerns.
