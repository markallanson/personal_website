[Get Slide for your own webpage](http://www.slide.com)

[Slide](http://www.slide.com "Slide") looks like the next evolution of photo sharing websites. It can make slide shows from RSS feeds too, so with a bit of modification to [my galleries](http://markallanson.net/gallery "My Gallery") RSS capabilities, I should be able to get a slide show going for each of my galleries.
