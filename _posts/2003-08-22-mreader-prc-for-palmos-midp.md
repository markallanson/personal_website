Thanks to Omer Trajman there is now an mReader 1.0 binary (PRC) for PalmOS devices. This can be downloaded onto a PalmOS handheld running Sun&#8217;s J2ME VM.

If you have a PalmOS Device and want to use mReader on it, [Check it out.](http://www.webwriting.com/java/mReader/mReader.html)

Omer, Thanks again!
