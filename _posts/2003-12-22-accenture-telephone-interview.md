If you read my last post regarding [Intellisense makes you lazy](http://www.markallanson.net/archives/000071.html), the test in question was for [Accenture website](http://www.accenture.com/) ([UK Website](http://www.accenture.co.uk/)) Technology Solutions. I was required to do a .NET test online to gauge my .NET knowledge. Seeings as I didn&#8217;t hear back from Accenture I was resigned to the fact that I had been passed over for a position, so you can imagine my surprise to get a phone call from Accenture&#8217;s HR Department (whilst driving a hire car through busy UK peak hour traffic, no less) requesing a first round telephone interview.

I&#8217;ve been doing prep work for the interview this morning, reading the [Accenture website](http://www.accenture.com/) ([UK Website](http://www.accenture.co.uk/)) etc. I have no idea what the aim of the interview is, whether its to gauge my personality or technical ability (which I would think is not easy to do over the telephone).

Wish me luck!
