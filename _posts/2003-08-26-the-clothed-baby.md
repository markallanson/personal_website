[Raymond Chen](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/) has an [interesting blog post](http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/commentview.aspx/f0f41757-dc6e-413f-b824-bdcfc033b98a) regarding how software needs to be tolerant to various cultures around the world, citing an example of the two different Windows 95 box holograms, one featuring a topless baby, another featuring a clothed baby. Aparently the topless baby was offensive to a certain unnnamed government.

Aparently topless babies can almost be considered a collectors item. Unfortunately my Windows 95 box has a clothed baby    <img src='https://markallanson.net/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />Ohwell no riches for me!

Out of interest, my Windows ME box, and my Windows 2k box both have no hologram. I wonder if that is a consequence of the above? Any idea on that Ray?

Thankfully [where I work](http://www.palmteq.com) we haven&#8217;t ran into these issues yet (other than currency display problems). Interesting stuff!
