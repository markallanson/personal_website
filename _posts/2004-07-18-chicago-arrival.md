What a great flight! Thank you [American Airlines](http://www.americanairlines.com/ "American Airlines Website"), I really needed a good flight. I cannot recommend AA more. _Big_ economy seats, _lots_ of leg room, _fantastic_ food. The flight left late, and arrived late, but still early afternoon. The cab ride to the hotel was quick, thank god for Sunday traffic.

After checking in at the hotel I went for a walk down North Michigan Avenue to the [Apple store](http://www.apple.com/retail/northmichiganavenue/ "N.Michigan Ave Apple Store") with the intention of picking up an [iPod Mini](http://www.apple.com/ipodmini/ "iPod Mini") for Sarah. Boy was I in for a surprise. Beautiful store, however they were out of stock with no more in for at least 5 weeks. Despite this I picked up a bunch of iPod Mini Accessories, just because they are so much cheaper over here than if you were buying from Apple back in the UK. I picked up the [iPod Mini Armband for when Sarah is working out](http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore.woa/72501/wo/Is2Aku3xx31z3nvRSMZBz3wIteX/1.1.7.1.0.6.7.0.2.0.0.2.0.3.1.1.0?35,43 "iPod Mini Armband"), [Griffin iTrip Mini FM Transmitter for those long car journey&#8217;s](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/itrip_mini/ "Griffin iTrip Mini") and an [XtremeMac iPod Car Charger for charging the iPod Mini on those long car journey&#8217;s](http://www.xtrememac.com/foripod/car_charger.shtml "XtremeMac iPod Car Charger"). I even sat in on a free Photoshop CS Pro workshop session, which was quite cool. Why doesn&#8217;t Microsoft do cool stuff like this?

I also snapped some photo&#8217;s from around about, and scouted where my training is going to be located. In fact, I can actually see One IBM plaza from my hotel room window (the room actually has _2_ windows!

[I have added some pictures to the gallery](http://www.markallanson.net/gallery/ChicagoSummer2004 "Chicago, Summer 204 Photo Gallery"). I will keep them updated during the week when I can. (Free Wifi in the hotel, whatever next?).
