I just completed an online technical assessment for a job that I recently applied for using .NET technologies. One thing that I have learnt from the test is that Intellisense makes you lazy. The test asked some quite specific questions regarding individual classes that I couldn&#8217;t remember purely because Intellisense in a way removes the need to remember specifics about individual classes.

Needless to say I&#8217;m not confident with my test results. I will find out soon enough.
