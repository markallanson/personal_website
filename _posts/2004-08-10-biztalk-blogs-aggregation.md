The RSS feed was for aggregation was getting very large (almost 1 meg), so the feed now only publishes the latest 20 items to the site, and size has dropped to about 200kb, much more managable._

I&#8217;ve started searching for Biztalk related blogs recently given that it is now my primary focus at work. I found a few and decided to make use of [Addy Santo&#8217;s](http://weblogs.asp.net/asanto "Addy Santo's Weblog") excellent [Blogwave](http://weblogs.asp.net/asanto/archive/2004/08/07/210663.aspx "Blogwave") to create an aggregated version of the weblogs I have found. Effectively this creates something similar to [Longhorn Blogs](http://www.longhornblogs.com "Longhorn Blogs"), an aggregated site on a specific topic.

So. You can point your aggregator to my [&#8220;Biztalk Blogs&#8221;](http://www.markallanson.net/biztalk/index.xml) aggregation which is updated every 30 minutes (so long as I leave my workstation on at the office, which is almost always). I will try and add an xslt stylesheet to this at some point aswell (Addy, feature request, allow linking to an xslt stylesheet?).

If anyone knows of any Biztalk Blogs I am missing, [drop me a line](mailto:mark@markallanson.net "Email me")

The List so far:

Note that I do know about [Martijn&#8217;s blog &#8211; E-Commerce, EAI and Biztalk](http://martijn.blogspot.com), however he only has an ATOM feed available and currently Blogwave only supports RSS.
