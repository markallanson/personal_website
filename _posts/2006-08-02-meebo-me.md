</center>I&#8217;m trying out the 

[MeeboMe](http://meebome.com "MeeboMe") Website -> IM gateway that has been launched by [Meebo](http://meebo.com "Meebo Website"). I have installed a widget in the sidebar to the right of the main page, and at the bottom of each post before the comments.

Please feel free to send me a message if I am online. This functionality will be good once Meebo launch a standalone IM client that doesn&#8217;t run in the browser&#8230; I don&#8217;t use meebo.com as my IM client because for me IM in the browser just doesn&#8217;t work &#8211; except in the case when I am at a client site or locked down office at work and need to get out of the great corporate firewall.

Let&#8217;s see how this goes.
