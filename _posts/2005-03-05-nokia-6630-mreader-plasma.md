  <img src="http://www.nokia.com/press/photo/phones/jpeg/6630_05.jpg" />I took ownership of a new <a href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,58708,00.html" title="Nokia 6630">Nokia 6630</a> phone this week. So far I haven&#8217;t been able to find anything worth complaining about. Thankfully the memory card format remains compatible with the SD card reader on my notebook (thanks to the supplied card-extender).</p>

    I can also happily report that both <a href="http://markallanson.net/html/technical/j2me/mReader.htm" title="mReader">mReader </a>and <a href="http://markallanson.net/html/technical/j2me/plasma.htm" title="Mark's Plasma">Mark&#8217;s Plasma</a> both work without any problems on on the Nokia 6630, so go ahead and <a href="http://mobile.markallanson.net/">download them both</a>. The performance of Marks Plasma is still relatively slow when running in full resolution, however when running in quarter resolution, it runs smooth enough to get the idea of what it should be looking like. I might try rewriting this application either natively for Symbian S60, or might try tweaking the algorithm to make it run faster. </div>
