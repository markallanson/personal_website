I have been using [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/) full time since they dropped the Pre-RC1 build last week. So far, so good. I had a welcome surprise this evening though when I plugged my EOS 350D into the computer and Vista recognised it straight away and let me pull down photo&#8217;s into the new Windows&nbsp; Photo Gallery.

It&nbsp; doesn&#8217;t sound all that fantastic, does it. 

About 2 weeks ago when I bought my iPod and Camera connector I had switched the camera over to using the Print/PTP protocol over USB as this is the protocol required to pull photos down to the iPod from the camera directly. I had inadvertantly left the camera in this setting, and thought about this as soon as I had plugged the camera into the computer. To my surprise, Windows Vista recognised the camera as an EOS 350D and proceeded to ask me if I wanted to pull the photos into [Windows Photo Gallery](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/forhome/gallery.mspx) and tag them all as they came down.

A big thank you to all the hommes and femmes working on camera support in Vista, you have potentially made my life much less frustrating not having to [remember to] constantly switch the camera between Print/PTP and PC Comms mode.

The next thing I need to do is see if [Zooomr](http://zooomr.com) automatically recognises the tags I add when importing into Vista. _[Ed: Nope, Zooomr didn't recognise the tags added in Vista. Bummer.]_

PS. Windows XP may be able to comms in the Print/PTP protocol &#8211; I can&#8217;t remember if I ever tried using it before in XP. Either way it didn&#8217;t have photo gallery software.
