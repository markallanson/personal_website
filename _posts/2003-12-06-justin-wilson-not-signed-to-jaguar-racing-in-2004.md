I&#8217;m extremely dissapointed that [Justin Wilson](http://www.justinwilson.co.uk/ "Justin Wilson Enterprises Website") was not signed to [Jaguar Racing](http://www.jaguar-racing.com/ "Jaguar Racing F1 Team Website") for the 2004 Formula 1 season. It seems like a raw deal to me, Leaving Minardi mid-season to join Jaguar after the dumping of [Antonio Pizzonia](http://www.antoniopizzonia.net/ "Antonio Pizzonia's Website"), then left high-and-dry by Jaguar Racing for the 2004 season.

I hope he finds another ride for the 2004 season, though I doubt he will be able to find one.
