Thats right, I am dumping Mozilla Firefox 0.8 in favor of Mozilla Firebird 0.7.

FireFox is just too buggy. I am experiencing hangs, high cpu usage, lockups. Nasty stuff, especially when you have 10-20 tabs or so open.

Maybe I could live with the FireFox hangs if they provided a &#8220;restore to previous state&#8221; like the current build of Opera has so that when you restart you don&#8217;t have to do \_everything\_ again!
