If you use GreaseMonkey then please please please read Mark Pilgrims post on a very severe, hugely easily exploitable bug in GreaseMonkey that could potentially send ANY file in your local hard disk to ANY url, ANYWHERE.

For full details: [Full details on GreaseMonkey exploit.http://mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-July/004022.html](http://mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-July/004022.html "Full details on GreaseMonkey exploit")

Please please uninstall GreaseMonkey until this is fixed, either that or remove all * targets and replace them with targets only to trusted websites.
