As a parting gift from my job at PalmTEQ I received a Palm Tungsten E. Going to be very handy indeed. As I am going away I needed to search for some decent travel related software for PalmOS. Out popped Amy Fong&#8217;s [(Free) Travel programs for Palm OS.](http://www.employees.org/~amyfong/travel/palmtravel.html "Travel programs for Palm OS."). Gotta love free stuff!
