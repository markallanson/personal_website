Want to ship something locally or globally? For the sake of dissing UPS, You should do all your [shipping](http://fedex.com) with [FedEx](http://fedex.com)

(This is in response to Scobles post [here](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/06/11.html#a10348). For the record, I think is juvinile, but its also a bit of fun!)
